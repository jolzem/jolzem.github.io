<!--This is my index Page. I listed some interesting information about custom keyboards here.
This is actually my second website made for this course, the first one being about my favorite anime.
I wasn't happy with the results, so i made this one. It is inspired by n-o-d-e.net.
This was written in englsih because when I write code I am in English mode, because the words 
in the code are in english(background, title etc.)-->

			<h1>Custom Keyboards</h1>
			<p>The hobby of building a custom keyboard is massively gaining popularity at the moment.
			<br>
			To Build a Custom Keyboard you need 5 parts.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Case</h3>
					<p>The Case is basically just the Housing of the Keyboard.
					All the Parts get screwed into it, so that they get held in place.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>PCB</h3>
					<p>The PCB is basically just the Motherboard of the Keyboard.
					You can either solder or just place the switches in, 
					depending of which type of PCB you have.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Switches</h3>
					<p>The switches are the actuators of the typing. They send a signal through
					the PCB, which sends it over the Cable to the PC.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Plate</h3>
					<p>The Plate is inbetween the Switches and the PCB. The Stabilisers, 
					which stabilize the longer keycaps are also mounted on the Plate.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Keycaps</h3>
					<p>The Keycaps are placed on the switches, so you can actually type.
					They come in different colors and sizes. 
					There are also Printed Keycaps and blank ones.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
