    <p>
      Hey there!
      My name is Johannes, and I'm a computer enthusiast born and raised in
      Germany. Recently, I graduated from school, majoring in IT and English,
      and I am now training to become an IT specialist. I am passionate about
      most things related to technology, but specifically I am passionate about
      using free and open-source software, exploring different aspects of
      Linux, setting up and tinkering with servers, and learning about online
      privacy and security. When I'm not busy with the command line, I enjoy
      playing video games and building/modifying mechanical keyboards. Apart
      from computers I enjoy making my own pourover coffee, I am a big fan of
      technical fashion and I like cars.

    <h2>About this website</h2>
    <p>
      While I might not have been using the internet much or at all during the
      web 1.0 times (which this site is heavily modeled after) I do believe that
      modern websites are unnecessarly bloated in many ways. They contain ads and
      trackers (that's just how capitalism works, I can't really complain about
      that) but also so much useless JavaScript. I agree that it is very useful
      in certain areas but sometimes it is just not needed. Like in the case of a
      news site, or a recipe site, which in my opinion could just be served
      statically without much (or any) JavaScript. Because of this, I created
      this website, to make a small contribution to the debloated minimal web.
      Just pure HTML and CSS with some (useful) quality of life JavaScript.
      No ads, trackers, or cookies.
