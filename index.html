            <h2>Welcome to my Webspace!</h2>
            <p>
                Here I maintain my <a href="/blog/" class="inline">Blog</a> 
                about various topics and with various guides.<br />
                You can learn more about me <a href="/about/" class="inline">here</a>.

            <h2>Why run this website?</h2>
            <p>
                As you (should) know, most websites collect data about you.<br />
                This is especially true for Social Media Sites, which this is supposed to be a substitute for.<br />
                I still use some Social Media like Reddit and Twitter, but basically just to look at what other people are doing and to share stuff with some communities. But back to my rant:<br />
                So the only logical option in my mind was to make a website with some kind of blog function to share my opinion and help people with problems, that I have had and solved.<br />
                And now you are here! I don't know how you got here, but feel free to explore every crevasse of this site.
