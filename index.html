      <h2>Why run this website?</h2>
      <p>
        As you (should) know, most websites collect data about you.
        This is especially true for social media sites, which this is supposed to be a substitute for.
        While I still occasionally use social media platforms like WhatsApp or (very rarely) Instagram, I strictly limit my usage to connecting with people I know in real life for social interactions only. But back to my rant:<br />
        So the only logical option in my mind was to make a website with some kind of blog function to share my opinion and help people with problems, that I have had and solved.<br />
        And now you are here! I don't know how you got here, but feel free to explore every crevasse of this site.
