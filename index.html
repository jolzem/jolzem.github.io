            <h2>Welcome to my Webspace!</h2>
            <p>
                Here I maintain my <a href="/blog/" class="inline">blog</a>
                about various topics and with various guides.<br />
                You can learn more about me <a href="/about/" class="inline">here</a>.<br />

            <h2>Why run this website?</h2>
            <p>
                I strive to expand and restore the minimal web by running this website without the clutter and distractions that are prevalent on many modern websites.
                Additionally, as you (should) know, most websites collect data about you.
                This is especially true for social media sites, which this is supposed to be a substitute for.
                While I still occasionally use social media platforms like WhatsApp or (very rarely) Instagram, I strictly limit my usage to connecting with people I know in real life for social interactions only. But back to my rant:<br />
                So the only logical option in my mind was to make a website with some kind of blog function to share my opinion and help people with problems, that I have had and solved.<br />
                And now you are here! I don't know how you got here, but feel free to explore every crevasse of this site.
